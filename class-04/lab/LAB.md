# LAB: Buffers - File Transformers

## Submission Instructions
* Follow the core submission instructions

### Before you begin
* You'll need to initialize this lab folder as a new node module, install your dependencies, setup your npm script commands, and pull in your config files

## Resources  
* [Buffer Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html)

## Code that writes code ...
* Using only buffers and bit manipulation, generate a file in the `files` folder called `loop.js` that initiates an array with 3 people's names, iterates them with a forEach loop, and console.log's each value.
* You may not use `Buffer.from()` to simply create a buffer `from` chunks of your target code. Rather, you will need to work character by character.
* Verify your work by running `node loop.js` from within the `files` folder and seeing the array items printed out.

## Testing 
* Test your units (assuming you break down the challenges into small, focused functions.
