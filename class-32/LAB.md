##### redux
###### app reducer (what we call the main reducer in lecture)
* export a reducer that holds the entire app state from `reducer/index.js`
* create a reducer that will combine your categories reducer and expenses reducer

###### expenses reducer

* this reducer should support the following interactions 
  * `EXPENSE_CREATE` -- store an expense

  * `EXPENSE_DELETE` -- delete an existing expense
* if you need others feel free to add them

###### action creators

##### Components
Create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram.  
``` 
App
  Provider 
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems
           CategoryForm  -- for updating categories
           ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
           [ExpenseItem]  -- list of ExpenseItems
              ExpenseForm -- for updating an expense
```

###### Update the CategoryItem Component

* should have a `buttonText` prop that will configure the submit buttons text

##### ExpenseItem Component 
* should have a button that will delete the expense from the Apps `onClick`
* should display the `name` and `price` of the component
