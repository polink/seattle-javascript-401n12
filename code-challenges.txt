1 - you need your own repo
	- you can use the repo you used in 201 and 301
	- you can make a new repo
	- example name "code challenges and DSA"

2 - repo structure
	- create a folder called "data-structures"
	- either create a folder name "challenges" or...don't
	- every code challenge needs to exist in its own folder
	Example
		- if I have a challenge that asks me to add all the values in an array
		- I'm going to create a new folder called 'add-values-in-array'
		- Inside my new folder I start a new node project (by doing npm init)
	- Please refer to the reference part of the repo for a sample structure

3 - don't forget your .gitignore
4 - follow the instructions in each lab.
