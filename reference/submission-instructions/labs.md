============================================================================

## Canvas Submission
* Link to the README.md in your lab repo
* **Code Sandbox Submissions**
  * Create a folder called `docs` (under `/public` for React apps)
  * Upload your README.md and any supportive images to this folder.
  * Submit a link to your `/docs/README.md` for your canvas submission
  
## Operation
* In the folder for each class in the class repository, you will find a `lab` folder
* The folder for each day in the repo contains:
  * LAB.md - The instructions for the lab
  * README.md - A template which you will fill out each day to submit your lab 
  * `starter-code` folders - Contains any starter code for your lab
* Create a new github repository for each lab
  * If there is a `starter-code` folder for the lab, **copy it's contents** *(not the folder itself)* into your new repository
* Ensure that your repository/branch is connected to travis-ci.com
* For deployable labs (servers)...
  * Ensure that your repository/branch is connected to a dyno at heroku.com
    * Create a new one for each day that contains a server deployment
    
## Configuration
 Configure the root of your code folder with the following files and directories. Thoughtfully name and organize any additional configuration or module files.
 * **README.md** - contains your lab documentation
 * **.env** - contains env variables (should be git ignored)
 * **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file 
 * **.eslintrc** - contains the course linter configuratoin
 * **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
 * **.travis.yml** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
 * **package.json** - contains npm package config
   * create a `lint` script for running eslint (eslint **/*.js)
   * create a `test` script for running tests
   * create a `start` script for running your server
 * **/\_\_tests\_\_/** - contains unit tests
 * **/docs** - Where your documentation will reside
 * **/docs/config**
 * **/docs/config/jsdoc.config.json** 
   * JSDOC Config File
   * Edit this for each lab, if your folder structure is different
 
## Deployment - Server Based Labs
 * Your server must be deployed at Heroku
 * If it requires a database, provision it
 * For APIs, your endpoints should all be testable remotely using httpie or postman
 * For Web Servers, your website must be reachable
 
## Deployment - React Labs
 * Your app must be deployed at AWS Cloudfront
 * Use an automated deployment, connecting your repository to AWS through cloud formation
 
## Testing
 * Write a complete set of tests for all data models, independent of the server
 * For testing the server and routes, use `supertest` to do end-to-end testing
   * What we're testing is not whether express works, but whether your routes are doing the correct things.
 * Your tests must be running green on travis.com
 
##  Documentation
 * Write JSDoc for every function
 * Run `jsdoc` and target the docs folder as the target for the build.
 * For API Servers, put an updated `swagger.json` file in the docs/config folder
   * Ensure that your API server has a /doc route to serve the swagger doc, using that config file as its source
 * Copy the README-template.md file from the instructions folder, rname it to `README.md` and include it in your lab folder.
   * Be sure to include the URLs to your server, api docs, and jsdocs at Heroku
   * Be sure to include a UML / Flow Drawing of your application
